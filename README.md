# NBA-Team-Analysis-python-project
This Python project analyzes NBA team and player stats over the past ten years using data scraped from the official NBA website. It compares regular season and playoff performances, visualizes trends with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, and forecasts stats using Smoothing. A unique highlight is the performance patterns of NBA Finals-winning teams.
This Python project presents a detailed analysis of NBA team performance and player statistics over the past ten years. It uses web scraping to extract data directly from the official NBA website and focuses on regular season and playoff comparisons. The analysis includes visualizations such as line plots, heatmaps, bar charts, and pie charts, created with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn in a Jupyter Notebook environment. Forecasting is done using Exponential Smoothing to predict team performance trends. A standout feature is the focused examination of championship-winning teams over the decade, identifying common patterns in their stats that contributed to their success. This project offers insightful, data-driven storytelling and serves as a strong base for future work like interactive dashboards and player-level forecasting.
