# NBA-Team-Analysis-python-project
This Python project analyzes NBA team and player stats over the past ten years using data scraped from the official NBA website. It compares regular season and playoff performances, visualizes trends with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, and forecasts stats using Smoothing. A unique highlight is the performance patterns of NBA Finals-winning teams.
